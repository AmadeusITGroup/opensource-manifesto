# Contributing to Amadeus Open Source Manifesto
Thank you for considering donating your precious time! We welcome contributions and appreciate your effort in improving our Manifesto. To ensure a smooth contribution process, please follow the guidelines below.

## Who can contribute
This Manifest serves as a contract between our organization, Amadeus, and the Open Source community. Therefore, any significant changes must originate from our employees. However, technical modifications — such as correcting typos or adjusting the document's layout—can also be proposed by external contributors.

## How to contribute
We accept the suggestions in the form of an **Issue** or a **Pull request**. Alternatively, you can use our internal Teams Channel: **OpenSource@1A** or by sending the suggestion to *opensource[at]amadeus.com*.

## What is the review process
The manifesto is a crucial document, and any significant changes made to it will undergo a thorough consultation and a review process. Initially, the OSPO Council will evaluate the proposed changes, followed by an inspection by our LEG IP department. Ultimately, approval must be granted by our CTO. 

As such, please ensure that you allow sufficient time for these changes to be implemented effectively.
